        My journey began at Vakifbank, one of Turkey's premier multi-specialist banks, where I leveraged the power of SQL to extract and organize data efficiently. This allowed me to evaluate loan viability and identify loans at risk of default, contributing significantly to the bank's success. I also automated cumbersome Excel processes into streamlined SQL workflows, resulting in a remarkable 25% reduction in report delivery time and enhancing overall business operations.
